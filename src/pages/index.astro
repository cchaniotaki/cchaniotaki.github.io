                Life is truly marvelous, especially when you chase and achieve your dreams.
                Along the way, you may encounter a few <i>"bugs"</i>, but if you strive,
                you may overcome them.
                Just as in life, <b>Software Engineering</b> faces issues.
                I derive immense satisfaction from resolving real-life challenges,
                and I'm eager to discover innovative methods for detecting and
                solving problems in the realm of Software Engineering as well.

                Science</a>
                at <a href="https://www.usc.edu/" class="text-blue-500">University of Southern California (USC)</a>,
                supervised by Prof. <a href="https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~halfond/" class="text-blue-500">William G.J.
                Halfond</a>.
                I received my bachelor's degree in 2018 from the
