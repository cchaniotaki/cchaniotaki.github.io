                Life is truly marvelous, especially when you chase and achieve your dreams.
                Along the way, you may encounter a few <i>"bugs,"</i> but if you strive,
                you may overcome them.
                Just as in life, <b>Software Engineering</b> faces issues.
                I derive immense satisfaction from resolving real-life challenges,
                and I'm eager to discover innovative methods for detecting and
                solving problems in the realm of Software Engineering as well.

                Currently, I am a Ph.D. Student in <a href="https://www.cs.usc.edu/" class="text-blue-500">Computer
                Science</a>
                at the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/" class="text-blue-500">University of Southern California (USC)</a>,
                supervised by Prof. <a href="https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~halfond/" class="text-blue-500">William G.J.
                Halfond</a>.
                I received my bachelor's degree in 2018 from the
                <a href="https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/dmst" class="text-blue-500">Department of Management Science and
                    Technology</a>

                Business</a> in Greece.
                In 2021, I finished a master's degree in

                at the same University.
                During my studies, I started working in the industry as a Software Engineer.
